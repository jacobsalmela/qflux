  <strong>Pseudo 3D Racing Game Written in Go, Using Ebitengine</strong>
</p>

This repo [drives this YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMuBvrEUO0NXrdv4XskujV2D1DqhhsUOU), which is the development log of creating the game.

- **Pseudo 3D Racing**: uses common pseudo 3D techniques to convert 3D coordinates to 2D screen space and scales objects appropriately
- **Driven by Ebitengine**: written with [Ebitengine](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) for simplicity and maintainability
- **Sprites and Vectors**: a mix of both for retro-feels and modern performance
- **Developer-friendly**: focus on small functions, clean code, and comments
- **UI / Text Menus**: no third-party libraries
- **Scene Management**: no third-party libraries
